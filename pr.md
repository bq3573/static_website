		I really like the title animation, it's so fun to watch. All of
	the rainbow effects and how the pictures pop out is really cool. I enjoy
	how the website is a review of energy drinks which I think is a cool idea.
2.
		I feel that our websites are pretty similar in terms of layout. A big difference
	I've noticed is the navigation bar, the text is a very light color on a light background
	which makes it a bit hard to read until you hover over the link and the text darkens.
	I think that hurts the user experience a little bit. The use of shared style sheets
	makes the code very maintainable, I think. The choice to put the header in a separate
	stylesheet is an interesting design choice that I really like.

		I think the structure of the code is great and readable, and the CSS and images are
	organized neatly into folders.
4.
		Some issues I would like to point out are that when you hover over a picture on the
	home page and the picture gets bigger, it overlaps with the header as you scroll down. Also
	the flavors on each page changing colors on hover is cool but it makes me think that they are
	links so it could get a little confusing.

		I would say overall, great job. I like the concept and the general layout of the site.
	The navigation bar could use some work to make it more readable but other than that, good job.
