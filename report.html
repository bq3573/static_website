        <li>1. My website aimss to give information about energy drinks, provide links and nutrition information about popular ones like Bang and Monster. Also to allow feedback on these drinks with a review page</li>
        <li>2. I believe all the images I used for this project were fine to use and I downloaded them from their specific sites. the Idea for this website is my own, and I only recieved help from a few tutorials found online.</li>
        <li>3. My site has more than 5 pages and each serve their own purpose. One is a home page, one is a review page, and the other 4 provide specific information about the individual energy drinks I chose to talk about.</li>
        <li>4. My site has a header that exists on every webpage with a specific title and buttons that will send you to the different pages of my website.</li>
        <li>5. These buttons act as navigation links.</li>
        <li>6. My site makes a lot of use for felx box and in smaller windows and smaller screens like a phone performs well.</li>
        <li>7. My webpages all share similar styles and I have a few css files, one for main stuff like paragraph and title formatting, another one for the header that is present on all webpages, and one specifically for my "leave a review" page.</li>
        <li>8. All my photos make use of the alt tag and have a name specifiying the description of the images.</li>
        <li>9. Each page has a unique favicon and title.</li>
        <li>10. All none html resources have their own folder. this includes and images folder and css folder.</li>
        <li>11. My site doesn't use any third-party tools</li>
        <li>12. I did try and validate all my webpages using the provided link and while I did make a lot of error corrections there were some that I either didn't know how to fix or couldn't fix.</li>
        <li>13. All my content uses similar alignment on every webpage to maintain a clean consistent style.</li>
        <li>14. There is adequate spacing around every individual "item" in my webpages so nothing bleeds against the boxes they are contained in.</li>
        <li>15. My site uses multiple fonts specifically between smaller text and header text. My header uses Ralway serif and the rest of my text uses Ralway sans-serif. Although this is different from what you reccommended my heading is very much a heading compared to genral text.</li>
        <li>16. My site has a leave a review form on its on distinct page.</li>
        <li>17. My site has external links at the bottom of every page to specify where my information is provided by. The pictures in my home page also have links embedded in them.</li>
        <li>18. I only use kebab-case in my code.</li>
        <li>19. I use animations to change colors and have movement among my headers. There are also a few other color changing animations throughout my website.</li>
        <li>20. I shared my repo with hcientist</li>
        <li>21. The names of all my files are lowercase.</li>
        <li>22. I am currently working on getting https up and running as I accidnely used too many failed authorizations. After submmiting I will respolve this.</li>
        <li>23. Refer to 22.</li>
        <li>24. Refer to 22.</li>
        <li>25. I have been steadily commiting and pushing changes to my git repo since I began the project.</li>
